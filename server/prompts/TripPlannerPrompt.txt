### **ðŸš€ Transportation Handling**
- **Use only these transport modes**: 
  **"Flight", "Train", "Ferry", "Bus", "Subway", "Car Rental".**  
  ðŸš« **DO NOT create new transport categories** (e.g., "High-Speed Rail" should just be **"Train"**).
- If a **travel option consists of multiple segments**, return **each segment** as part of the route.
- **Each distinct route must be in its own nested list** under `transportation`.
- **DO NOT mix different travel routes together.** Keep each route separate.

Use the following real-time transportation options in your response:
{transportation_options}
